if you can install express from you own version which you can get(by default latest can be installed)  than npm install express@4.16.2


^(carrot symbol) --> Install all recommended and Minor fixes automatically(but locks the fist bit i.e 4 here and as updates comes automatically updates the version in  2nd and 3rd bit)

~ --> This can fix two starting bits means fix(and version bit,recommend bug bit) if there is update comes only automatally update in 3rd bit only


from ^ symbaol is not used only 4.18.2 uses instead of ^4.18.2 if there is update comes update manually because it is fixed not updated manually

^ symbol also hepls to update bits automaticaaly if updates comes while first bt remains same
